## 1. Why Clipboard Data Must Be Encrypted

Clipboard content is uniquely sensitive. It often contains:

* Passwords, verification codes, API tokens
* Private keys, configuration snippets
* Internal documents or unreleased content

Most clipboard tools treat this data as transient or harmless. In reality, it is one of the highest-risk data surfaces on any device.

**UniClipboard was designed around a single premise:**

> Convenience should never require surrendering control over your data.

---

## 2. Core Security Principles

UniClipboard’s encryption system is built on four non-negotiable principles:

1. **User-Controlled**
   Encryption is initiated and owned by the user. Keys are derived from user input, not generated by the service.

2. **End-to-End Encrypted**
   Data is encrypted before it leaves the device and decrypted only on trusted devices.

3. **Zero-Knowledge by Design**
   UniClipboard cannot read your clipboard content—by architecture, not by policy.

4. **Minimal Exposure**
   Plaintext exists only where strictly necessary, and only for the shortest possible time.

---

## 3. High-Level Architecture

Once encryption is enabled, the data flow is straightforward:

```
Clipboard Content
   → Local Encryption (Client)
   → Encrypted Sync Channel
   → Local Decryption (Target Device)
```

Key implications:

* Sync servers and relay nodes only ever see encrypted payloads
* Network transport does not affect cryptographic guarantees
* Trust boundaries remain entirely on user devices

---

## 4. Key Management Model

### 4.1 Layered Key Design

UniClipboard uses a layered key hierarchy to avoid single-point compromise:

```
User Passphrase
        ↓
Key Encryption Key (KEK)
        ↓
Master Key
        ↓
Clipboard Data Encryption
```

**Roles of each layer:**

* **User Passphrase**
  Never uploaded. Never used directly for data encryption.

* **KEK (Key Encryption Key)**
  Derived from the passphrase. Used only to protect the master key.

* **Master Key**
  Encrypts clipboard data. Can be rotated or replaced without changing the passphrase.

---

### 4.2 Secure Local Storage

Encrypted keys are stored using platform-native secure storage whenever available:

* macOS Keychain
* Windows Credential Manager
* Linux Secret Service (with secure fallback)

Disk access alone is insufficient to recover plaintext data.

---

## 5. Clipboard Data Encryption Strategy

### 5.1 Encryption Granularity

Encryption is applied **per clipboard entry**, not as a monolithic database:

| Content Type               | Strategy                   |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Small text                 | Inline encrypted payload   |
| Large data (images, files) | Encrypted blob storage     |
| Temporary entries          | User-configurable behavior |

This design improves performance while preserving security boundaries.

---

## 6. Sync Security Model

### 6.1 Local Network Sync

* Encrypted payloads only
* Packet capture yields no usable content

### 6.2 Remote Sync

* Servers act purely as encrypted relays
* No access to master keys
* No ability to decrypt stored or in-transit data

UniClipboard does not rely on “trust us” claims—only on cryptographic constraints.

---

## 7. Threat Model

### 7.1 What UniClipboard Protects Against

| Threat                    | Protected |
| ------------------------- | --------- |
| Network eavesdropping     | Yes       |
| Server data breach        | Yes       |
| Cloud storage compromise  | Yes       |
| Man-in-the-middle attacks | Yes       |

### 7.2 Explicit Non-Goals

* Fully compromised devices
* User-leaked passphrases
* OS-level malware

Security is strongest when threat boundaries are stated clearly.

---

## 8. User Control & Transparency

Users can:

* Enable or disable encryption at any time
* Control what content is synchronized
* Pause syncing instantly
* Reset encryption (with intentional data invalidation)

Cryptographic logic and protocol design are publicly documented to support independent verification.

---

## 9. Conclusion

Encryption in UniClipboard is not an optional feature or a marketing checkbox.

It is the foundation of the product.

We believe:

* Your data belongs to you
* Sync does not imply custody
* Privacy should not be traded for convenience
